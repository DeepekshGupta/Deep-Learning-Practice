We have a dataset of a bank
The bank has been seeing some unusual churn rates (People leaving the bank) and they want to understand whats going on
6 months ago, they took a sample of 10k customers, and created the column exited in the dataset of all the customers who left (1 meaning they left)
our goal is to create a geodemographic segmentation model to tell the bank which of the customers are at the highest risk of leaving
(the same logic can be applied for should the person be given a loan or not, or a credit or not)
